Here is a SQL query to identify the company's most popular movies by amount paid and times rented:

SELECT  F.title,
        F.rating,
        E.name,
        COUNT(B.rental_id) AS times_rented,
        SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
LEFT JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id =B.rental_id
LEFT JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
LEFT JOIN film_category D ON C.film_id = D.film_id
LEFT JOIN category E ON D.category_id = E.category_id
LEFT JOIN film F ON C.film_id = F.film_id
GROUP BY F.title, E.name, F.rating
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC, times_rented
