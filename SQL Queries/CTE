Here is a SQL query with a common table expression:

WITH top_customers_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, amount_paid) AS
(SELECT C.customer_id,
        C.first_name,
        C.last_name,
        E.city,
        F.country,
        Sum(A.amount) AS amount_paid
   FROM payment A
        INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
        INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
        INNER JOIN city E ON city_id = E.city_id
        INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
  WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig')
  GROUP BY  C.customer_id,
            C.first_name,
            E.city,
            F.country
  ORDER BY amount_paid DESC
  LIMIT 5)
SELECT A.country,
       Count(DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
       Count(DISTINCT E.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM   country A
       INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
       INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
       INNER JOIN top_customers_cte E ON D.customer_id = E.customer_id
       LEFT JOIN top_customers_cte E ON D.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY A.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC, top_customer_count
