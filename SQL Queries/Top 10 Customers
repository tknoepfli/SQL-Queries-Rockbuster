Here is an SQL query using INNER JOIN to identify the company's top 10 customers:

SELECT  C.first_name,
        C.last_name,
        F.country,
        SUM(amount) AS amount_paid
        FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name, country
ORDER BY amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 10
