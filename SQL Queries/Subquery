SELECT AVG(amount_paid) AS average
FROM
(SELECT C.customer_id,
        C.first_name,
        C.last_name,
        E.city,
        F.country,
SUM(A.amount) AS amount_paid
FROM payment A
     INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
     INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
     INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
     INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
     INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
WHERE city IN (‘Aurora’, ‘Tokat’, ‘Tarsus’, ‘Atlixco’, ‘Emeishan’, ‘Pontianak’, ‘Shimoga’, ‘Aparecida de Goinia’, ‘Zalantun’, ‘Taguig’)
GROUP BY C.customer_id, C.first_name, C.last_name, E.city, F.country
