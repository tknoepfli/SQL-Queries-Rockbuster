Here is a SQL query to identify top revenue by movie genre:

SELECT  E.name,
        SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
LEFT JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
LEFT JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
LEFT JOIN film_category D ON C.film_id = D.film_id
LEFT JOIN category E ON D.category_id = E.category_ID
GROUP BY E.name
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
